-- Use master;

-- The "USE master;" command is typically used to switch to the master database, but it's unnecessary in this context as you are already in the master database by default when running the script.

-- Create database
CREATE DATABASE [RetailStores];
GO

-- Switching to the newly created database
USE [RetailStores];
GO
